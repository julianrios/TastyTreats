Passion Project Idea 

## Apis
Zomato API - Recipes
Spoonacular API -> Recipes 
Pinterest API -> Collections 

## Passion Project Summary
My idea would be an application that would allow users to generate personalized collections of recipes they would like to go make. Or based on their preferences curated collections of recipes would be generated for them. This application would simplify the cooking process. The act of searching through bookmarks in a folder and sifting through ads to get to the recipe would be no more. The idea is to use Spoonacular and Zomato for gathering recipe information. Then the Pinterest API would be used as a hub for containing the collections and finding other collections created by users. The underlying problem I would like to solve is making an app that allows people to easily find recipes to do based on their skill, diet, and available time to complete a given recipe.

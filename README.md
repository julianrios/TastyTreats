Zomato API
Yelp API
FourSquare API
Google Maps API & Places API
ParkWhiz API
Pinterst API

## Passion Project Summary
My idea would be an application that would allow users to generate personalized collections of places they would like to go to. Based on their preferences curated collections of places would be generated for them. This application would be centralized in the Philly area specifically Fishtown and some surrounding areas. The idea is to use Foursquare, Yelp, and Zomato for gathering local information about places around the area. Then use google maps and parkwhiz to help with finding parking. The Pinterest API would be used as a hub for containing the collections and finding other collections created by users. The underlying problem I would like to solve is making an app that allows people to easily find things to do based on their interests or find interesting things based on other peoples collections.
